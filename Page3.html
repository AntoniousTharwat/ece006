        <h1>Artificial intelligence applications</h1>
        <p>
            There are numerous, real-world applications of AI systems today. Below are some of the most common examples:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.Speech Recognition:</b>
            <br/>
            It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition,
            or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to process human speech into
            a written format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g.
            Siri—or provide more accessibility around texting.
            <br/>
            <br/> 
            <b>2.Recommendation Engines:</b>
            <br/>
            Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends
            that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. This is used to make relevant add-on recommendations
            to customers during the checkout process for online retailers.
