        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>
            While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades,
            John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside IBM),
            " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
            It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to
            confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."
            However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by
            Alan Turing's seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (PDF, 89.8 KB)(link resides outside of IBM),
            which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the
            following question, "Can machines think?"  From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test",
            where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has
            undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing
            concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics.
            Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
            link resides outside IBM), becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve
            into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of
            rationality and thinking vs. acting:

        <p>
            Human approach:
            <br>
            1.Systems that think like humans
            <br>
            2.Systems that act like humans
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideal approach:
            <br>
            1.Systems that think rationally
            <br>
            2.Systems that act rationally
